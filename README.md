# random-tic-tac-toe-simulation
This project implements a `TTTBoard` class that represents a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board and simulates games where both players play randomly. It estimates the probability that player X wins.

## ðŸ“Š Goal:
Estimate the probability that X wins in random Tic Tac Toe games.

## ðŸ§  Concepts:
- Object-Oriented Design
- Board game logic and simulation
- Randomness and probability
- Class encapsulation

## ðŸ“‹ Features:
- `.display()`: Pretty-prints the board
- `.set()`, `.occupied()`: Board manipulation
- `.row_full()`, `.col_full()`, `.diag_full()`, `.win_for()`: Win detection
- `.random_move()`: Places move in random open spot
- Simulation of 10,000 games

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output:
Probability X is the winner: 0.5842
